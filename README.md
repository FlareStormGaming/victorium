Victorium is a minecraft mod centered around adding extra progression to the game, through the material called "victorium."
\
Currently, Victorium can be found in the overworld, and it can be used to make a variety of items (which will be being used in the future to obtain end ores and complete end progression).

  I used some of [Electroblob](https://github.com/Electroblob77)'s textures in development versions of the mod, as they were similar to some of the end goals of the       textures I actually wanted in the mod, so that's why this shout-out is here.
